       "'1.What exactly is []?\\n\\nAns-->empty list\\n\\n2.In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value \"hello\" as the\\n\\nthird value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\\n\\nAns-->spam.insert(2,\\'hello\\')\\n\\n \\n\\nLets pretend the spam includes the list [\\'a\\', \\'b\\', \\'c\\', \\'d\\'] for the next three queries.\\n\\n3. What is the value of spam[int(int(\\'3\\' * 2) / 11)]?\\n\\nAns-->\\'d\\'\\n\\n4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\\n\\nAns-->\\'d\\'\\n\\n5. What is the value of spam[:2]?\\n\\nAns-->[\\'a\\',\\'b\\']\\n\\nLet\\'s pretend bacon has the list [3.14, \\'cat,\\' 11, \\'cat,\\' True] for the next three questions.\\n\\n6. What is the value of bacon.index(\\'cat\\')?\\n\\nAns-->1(it shows the first match of cat index)\\n\\n7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\\n\\nAns-->[3.14,\\'cat\\',11,\\'cat\\',True,99]\\n\\n8. How does bacon.remove(\\'cat\\') change the look of the list in bacon?\\n\\nAns-->[3.14,\\'cat\\',11,\\'cat\\',True,99]\\n\\n9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\\n\\nAns -->list concatenation --\\'+\\' ..concatinates two lists --b=[1,2],c=[3,4] b+c =[1,2,3,4]\\n\\n       list replication --\\'*\\'  .. replicates list -- b=[1,2] b*2 --[1,2,1,2]\\n\\n10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\\n\\nAns -->list.append(value ) method adds the value at last position , list.insert(index,value) method helps us add the value at index of our choice\\n\\n \\n\\n11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\\n\\nAns --> bacon.remove(value)--removes the value ,bacon.pop(index)--removes the value at given index\\n\\n                                del bacon(x:y) deletes values from x to y-1 index\\n\\n12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\\n\\nAns -->\\n\\nBoth lists and strings can be passed to len(), have indexes and slices,\\n\\nbe used in for loops, be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators.\\n\\n \\n\\n13. What\\'s the difference between tuples and lists?\\n\\nAns--                                                     List                                                                                                                         Tuple\\n\\n                                     1.List is mutable                       1.Tuples are immutable\\n\\n                                                2.list is better for performing         2.tuple is best for accessing\\n\\n             operations such as insertion                                               \\n\\n                                                 and deletion\\n\\n             3.Lists has several inbuilt methods             3.Tuple doesn\\'t have many inbuilt methods                                       \\n\\n \\n\\n14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\\n\\nAns --tup=(42,) trialing comma(,) is mandatory\\n\\n15. How do you get a list value\\'s tuple form? How do you get a tuple value\\'s list form?\\n\\nAns -->The tuple(list_name) and list(tuple_name) functions, respectively\\n\\n16. Variables that \"contain\" list values don\\'t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?\\n\\nAns -->Please tell answer for this question\\n\\n17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\\n\\nAns-->copy.deepcopy creates a copy of the object and elements of the object , whereas copy.copy creates copy\\n\\n      of the object but references each element of the object\\n\\n                                import copy\\n\\n                                old_list=[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]\\n\\n                                new_list=copy.copy(old_list)\\n\\n                                new_list[0]=[\\'a\\',\\'b\\']\\n\\n                                print(old_list)---o/p->[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]\\n\\n                                print(new_list)---o/p->[[\\'a\\',\\'b\\'],[3,4],[5,6]]\\n\\n                               \\n\\n                                import copy\\n\\n                                old_list=[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]\\n\\n                                new_list=copy.copy(old_list)\\n\\n                                new_list[0][0]=[\\'a\\']\\n\\n                                print(old_list)---o/p->[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]\\n\\n                                print(new_list)---o/p->[[\\'a\\',2],[3,4],[5,6]]\\n                                \\n'"
